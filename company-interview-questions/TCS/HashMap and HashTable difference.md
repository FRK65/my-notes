# HashMap and HashTable difference

**Internal Working of Hash Table and Hash Map**

Both Hash Tables and Hash Maps are data structures that store key-value pairs, 
thier goal is to providing fast access to values based on their associated keys. 

- Hash Table and Hash Map both provide a way to store and access data based on keys,
  but their implementations may differ slightly.
- The primary difference is often how each handles null values and thread safety.
- **Hash Tables generally do not allow null keys or null values and are less thread-safe by default.**

- **Hash Map is more commonly used in modern programming languages like Java and Python due to its flexibility and optimizations.**



### **Hash Table vs. Hash Map:**

- **Thread Safety:**
  - **Hash Table:** Not safe for use by multiple threads at the same time. If multiple threads try to use it together, it might cause problems.
  - **Hash Map:** Also not safe for multiple threads by default. But in some cases, you can make it thread-safe with extra work (like `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java).

- **Null Values/Keys:**
  - **Hash Table:** It **does not allow** null values or null keys. So, you can’t store `null` as a key or value.
  - **Hash Map:** It **allows** null values and sometimes even null keys. (In Java, for example, you can have a `null` key and `null` values in a `HashMap`.)

- **Use in Programming:**
  - **Hash Table:** It’s an older concept. You’ll see it more in older languages or older parts of some languages.
  - **Hash Map:** It’s more commonly used in modern programming (like Java, Python, etc.), and it tends to have some extra features for optimization.

### Summary:**
- Both store data using keys and values.
- **Hash Tables** are a bit more restrictive (no nulls and not thread-safe).
- **Hash Maps** are more flexible (they allow nulls and are easier to work with in modern code).

------------------------------
The terms **Hash Table** and **Hash Map** are often used interchangeably.

### **Hash Table**
A **Hash Table** is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. 
It uses a **hash function** to compute an **index (hash code)** into an **array of buckets** or slots, 
from which the desired value can be found. Hash Tables typically **do not allow null keys or values**.

#### Real-life example:
Imagine you're organizing a library's book collection. 
Each book has a unique **Book ID** (which is the key) and the book itself (which is the value). 
When someone asks for a book, you look it up by its ID. You use a **hash function** to quickly 
find which shelf (or index in the array) that book should be on, without searching through the entire library.

In a **Hash Table**, if you try to add a book with a **null** Book ID (key) or a **null** book (value), 
the operation would fail, because Hash Tables typically don't support null keys or values.

### **Hash Map**
A **Hash Map** is similar to a Hash Table, but it is typically a more 
**flexible and modern implementation** that allows for **null values and keys** 
(depending on the language). 
**HashMap** is often used in Java, and in some contexts, 
Hash Maps allow concurrent access (thread-safe), while Hash Tables are usually not.

#### Real-life example:
Going back to the library analogy: imagine you have a new **online library catalog** 
that needs to store books in a way that allows flexible data entries. 
A **Hash Map** allows you to store entries where the **Book ID** can be 
`null` (if you don’t have a Book ID for a special category of books) or 
the **Book information** (value) can be `null` if a book is temporarily unavailable.

In a **Hash Map**, it’s perfectly fine to have a missing key or value 
(e.g., you can have a book with no ID or a placeholder for a book that’s not yet in stock).

### **When to Use Each?**

1. **Use a Hash Table** when:
   - You need a very fast lookup of data where **null** keys or values are not allowed.
   - Thread safety is a concern (although modern Hash Maps can also be synchronized if needed).
   - You are working in environments like **older versions of Java** where Hash Tables were commonly used.

   **Example:** Storing user sessions on a website where every session has a unique ID (key)
   and you want to prevent storing any invalid or incomplete data (no null values or keys).

3. **Use a Hash Map** when:
   - You need more flexibility, such as allowing **null** keys or values.
   - Thread safety is not a concern, or if it is, you can handle synchronization yourself.
   - You are working with **modern Java** or languages that prefer **Hash Maps** for efficiency and flexibility.

   **Example:** Creating a map of employee information where some employees may not
   have an employee ID yet (a `null` key) or where some employee data might be missing or
   temporarily unavailable (a `null` value).

---

### Key Differences:
- **Thread Safety:** Hash Tables are synchronized (older versions of Java). Hash Maps are **not** synchronized, but you can handle synchronization manually if needed.
- **Null values and keys:** Hash Tables typically don't allow `null`, while Hash Maps usually do.
- **Performance:** Hash Maps tend to be more flexible and performant in modern applications because they don't incur the overhead of synchronization unless explicitly needed.
